### Project Description
A deliberately frustrating password generator that takes the absurdity of website password requirements to the next level. It generates passwords so secure, even you won't be able to remember them! 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Current password requirements are way too simple and user-friendly! Users are getting away with passwords that only need uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, their great-grandmother's maiden name, and their first pet's zodiac sign. We need to make this process MORE complicated!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the Totally Legit Password Generator - where every password must contain:
- At least one hieroglyph
- A mathematical equation that proves P ≠ NP
- The exact GPS coordinates of where you had your first ice cream
- Three emojis that tell your life story
- A quote from a movie that bombed at the box office
- The chemical formula for your favorite food

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Vue (To Fast Annoyance to Public)
- HTML/CSS (Making it look legitimately annoying)
- JavaScript (For real-time password strength depression)
- Claude + GPT - 4o 
### Implementation
# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gennyofficial/useless_project_temp.git
vue create useless_project_temp
cd useless_project_temp
```
